Notabene
============

**NotaBene** is a tool that brings best practices from software engineering to data analysis and data science.


   Information and knowledge is best transfered when it is presented in a familiar way.
   By using templates you can encourage this and enforce a culture in which knowledge sharing is a top level priority.


This CLI-tool makes it easy for anyone in your project or repository to create new templates, use templates and verify that your notebooks make use of the vetted templates.
It only takes two simple steps to introduce NotaBene into your repository.
To do so, follow the :ref:`quickstart guide <quickstart>`.
